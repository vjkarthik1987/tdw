                <p>Basecamp, on its website, has mentioned that ‘everything is harder when we all believe different things about what’s important to us. Nothing is closer to the truth.</p>
                <p>An organization is a collection of diverse individuals, with their own set of values and beliefs and we must respect these beliefs and values. But, it is equally important that we, as an organization, have our own beliefs. This will guide us when we are in doubt or when we are in a conflicting situation. The following are our beliefs that we stand by and aim to practice consistently. In fact, these beliefs apply to TDW as an organization also.</p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li>
                        <p class="fw-bold">Do the right thing</p>
                        <p class="list-subitem">It is tough to explain because ‘the right thing’ is always relative. Use your judgement to decide what is the right thing. Sometimes, it may be giving your team a day more to complete the project even if it means that we will miss a customer deadline. Or it may be telling ‘Yes’ to a co-worker’s request for help even if you are swamped with work, but you know the co-worker is going through a tougher time. Or it may be giving a customer one more week to renew their subscription because they honestly forgot to renew. Whatever it is, be reasonable, and always remember - to keep the best interest of you and TDW in mind.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="fw-bold">Be yourself, but do not be a jerk</p>
                        <p class="list-subitem">We do not hire for cultural fit, because we want people to be different. We value diversity - in thoughts, mindsets, ways of working, and in many more aspects. You do not have to change yourself because you joined us. Relationships do not last in such a world. We hired you for what you are and we want you to stay true to that. If you are an introvert and do not like team outings, we will not force you to attend them. If you are a night owl who likes to code in the night, we will not force you to change your ways. But, we will not tolerate a jerk. A jerk can not only kill a team, but destroy the entire organization. If you are a jerk, you can still be yourself, but outside TDW.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="fw-bold">Give your best shot</p>
                        <p class="list-subitem">Always give your best shot. Do not leave anything for a second chance, because you may never get a second chance. For example, if you are building a feature for our client, and you need one more day to complete it fully, go ahead and tell the client. A day will not make a difference. But, give it your best shot. Do not give anything that is half-baked or undercooked. We do not think humans, other than Hannibal Lecter can digest raw or undercooked food. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="fw-bold">Be calm, conscious, and considerate</p>
                        <p class="list-subitem">Things will get crazy. Be calm. The surroundings will get chaotic and customers will get cranky. Be conscious of your work, your capabilities, your team, and what we stand for as an organization. And remember - be considerate - to your colleagues, to our customers, and to our partners.  Surprise them with your careful consideration. While we cannot be like Buddha, let us be like Zen masters. Most importantly, treat others in a way that you want yourself to be treated.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="fw-bold">Don’t hesitate to speak up, and don’t forget to take notes</p>
                        <p class="list-subitem">Speaking up is a skill and many a time, people assume that you are OK with their suggestion because you did not speak up. Voice your opinion, even if it is against the general consensus of the group. And if someone voices their opinion, be calm and considerate enough to hear it out. Discuss it, in a meeting, over a cup of coffee, or on a video call, or even through chat. But do not let a thought or a counter-thought pollute your mind for the want of not saying it out. And always remember, we live in a world where meetings are normal and distractions are more normal. We all tend to have a shorter attention span. In such a world, it helps to take notes. You never know that it may come in handy to point out a hypocrite if you ever meet one.</p>
